HttpFoundation Session Component
========================

In Wordpress development I kept finding myself wanting to use only some but not all of Symfony's HTTPFoundation.

This library includes only the Response classes from HttpFoundation.
 
All of HTTPFoundation is included in these libraries:
  * [pno/request](https://github.com/penoonan/request)
  * [pno/session](https://github.com/penoonan/session)  
  * [pno/bag](https://github.com/penoonan/bag)
  * [pno/file](https://github.com/penoonan/file)
  * [pno/response](https://github.com/penoonan/response)
  * [pno/foundation-tests](https://github.com/penoonan/foundation-tests)
